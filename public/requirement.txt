GadgetHeaven ✨ Your go-to destination for the latest and greatest gadgets

The site should feature a structured navigation bar, product categories, and individual product details pages. Key functionalities include a shopping cart ✅, a wishlist system ✅, and product filtering ✅. The Context API will manage the cart and wishlist, with optional LocalStorage for data persistence ✅.

- At least 3 categories and the first category must have 6 data sets. Other categories may have 2 or more data. (6 + 2*2 = 10 data in total). Each item’s price will be at least 50 $ (not less than 50 $, could be more) and unique. ✅
- Clicking on any category will show gadgets of that specific category on the right. Do this using nested layout ✅

Challenge Tasks
- You can see that in Figma for the home page, the background color is different from the background color of the navbar on other pages. Implement this using useLocation() hook ✅
- Clicking the Purchase button will Congratulate using Modal. Then the cart will be empty/total price will be 0, (without reloading the page or using window.href). Keep this button disabled if the cart is empty and the total price is 0. After clicking on the “Close button” of the modal it will redirect you to the home page. Do this navigation using useNavigate() hook. ✅
- Use favicon for your website and add dynamic title for each page on your website. ✅

Resources
Optional but Recommended To Explore: (It doesn’t contain any marks)
- Limit adding items to the cart after reaching a maximum (inclusive) 1000 $. Implement removing items from the Cart. Removing items from the Cart will also decrease the total price, and then different items can be added to the cart until it reaches 1000 $ (inclusive).
- Implement removing items from the Wish List. Cards within the wishlist will also have an ‘Add to cart’ button, Clicking this button will remove the item from the wishlist, and also add it to the Cart. In case of failure (Cart exceeding total 1000 $), don’t perform this, and show an error toast.
- Statistics Page:
  On this page, a Composed Chart will appear. This will be a Price vs. product name Composed chart. That means, the Y-axis will show Prices and the X-axis will be the Product name. Area and Bar data will show according to Prices, scatter data will show according to rating.
